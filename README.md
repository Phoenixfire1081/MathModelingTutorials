## Tutorials for the course Math modeling in climate research

These tutorials were made with jupyter-notebook for the math modeling course taught at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin during the winter semester 2019 and summer semester 2020.

### Winter semester 2019

The tutorials were prepared by me and deal with problems in the following

- Dimensional analysis with the python package pint
- Linear oscillator asymptotics
- Shallow water equations (SWE)
- Solver for the SWE

### Winter semester 2020

The tutorials were prepared by Prof. Nikki Vercauteren and deal with problems in the following:

- Dynamical systems: critical points, phase diagrams
- Lorenz system
- Stommel model
