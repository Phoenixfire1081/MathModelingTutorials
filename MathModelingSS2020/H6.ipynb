    "As opposed to wind-driven currents and tides (which are due to the gravity of the moon and the sun), the thermohaline circulation (THC) (Figure 1) is that part of the ocean circulation which is driven by density differences. Sea water density depends on temperature and salinity, hence the name thermo-haline. The salinity and temperature differences arise from heating/cooling at the sea surface and from the surface freshwater fluxes; evaporation and sea ice formation enhance salinity, precipitation, runoff and ice melt decrease salinity. Heat sources at the ocean bottom play a minor role."

    "In contrast to the wind-driven currents, the THC is not confined to surface waters but can be regarded as a big overturning of the world ocean, from top to bottom. The thermohaline circulation consists of:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "-> Deep water formation: the sinking of water masses, closely associated with (but not to be confused with) convection, which is a vertical mixing process. Deep water formation takes place in a few localised areas: the Greenland-Norwegian Sea, the Labrador Sea, the Mediterean Sea, the Wedell Sea, the Ross Sea.<br><br>\n",
    "-> Spreading of deep waters, mainly as deep western boundary currents (e.g. North Atlantic Deep Water, NADW, and Antarctic Bottom Water, ABW).<br><br>\n",
    "-> Upwelling of deep waters: this is not localized and difficult to observe. It is thought to take place mainly in the Antarctic Circumpolar region, possibly aided by the wind (Ekman divergence). <br><br>\n",
    "-> Near-surface currents: these are required to close the flow. For example in the Atlantic, the surface currents compensating the outflow of NADW range from the Benguela Current off South Africa via Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Current into the Nordic Seas off Scandinavia. (Note: the Gulf Stream is primarily wind-driven, and the thermohaline circulation contributes only roughly  20\\% to the Gulf Stream).<br>\n",
